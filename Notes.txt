TO-DO:
- Esc button: to exit popup window
- add window shadow for cool effect
- database export/import?
- on popup menu open and clicked one option close the menu
- allow multi database selection?
- logics: create extra column in a txt file/settings and disable rest keep the one you want ( maybe using 1 and 0)
- if no date use DateTime.MinValue then replace that with custom text after checking e.g.
- if datetime is less than today then show "to set"?
- on edit row add a spy signal "amber" for changes that have not been saved yet
- Delete invoice row after confirmation.
But only if:
Not paid
Not exported
Not finalised
- cancel makes no sense, I'd say if the user selected not invoiced after he sent it for some reason that he changed mind. 
he selected not invoiced then confirmation box yes/no. that row with invoice details will be saved in a e.g. "rubbish" folder in txt. 
format and have a button maybe to access deleted clients, jobs, invoices (however this is out of scope for the first version)
- on delete row delete folder too
- add location based activities (e.g. invoice created at company on a map)
- check use of override function and correct wether before or after the return thingg
