TO-DO:
- Esc button: to exit popup window
- add window shadow for cool effect
- database export/import?
- on popup menu open and clicked one option close the menu
- allow multi database selection?
- logics: create extra column in a txt file/settings and disable rest keep the one you want ( maybe using 1 and 0)
- if no date use DateTime.MinValue then replace that with custom text after checking e.g.
- if datetime is less than today then show "to set"?
- on edit row add a spy signal "amber" for changes that have not been saved yet
- Delete invoice row after confirmation.
But only if:
Not paid
Not exported
Not finalised
- cancel makes no sense, I'd say if the user selected not invoiced after he sent it for some reason that he changed mind. 
he selected not invoiced then confirmation box yes/no. that row with invoice details will be saved in a e.g. "rubbish" folder in txt. 
format and have a button maybe to access deleted clients, jobs, invoices (however this is out of scope for the first version)








NOTES:
Job status:
- New
- Active
- Done

Invoice status:
- Not invoiced
- Sent
- Paid
- Overdue

Not invoiced: if not created invoice
sent: invoice created and due date set up
paid: money received before due date (not paid)
overdue: money not received before due date (not paid + missed deadline)

















DateTime:
from string to DateTime:
    DateTime dueDate = DateTime.ParseExact(
    DueDate,
    "dd/MM/yyyy",
    CultureInfo.InvariantCulture

back to string:
<TextBox Text="{Binding DueDate, StringFormat={}{0:dd/MM/yyyy}}"
         IsReadOnly="True"/>
dueDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")





cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(
    "@due",
    dueDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")
);


DateTime dueDate = DateTime.ParseExact(
    dbValue,
    "yyyy-MM-dd",
    CultureInfo.InvariantCulture
);


DateTime.ParseExact(input, "dd/MM/yyyy", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)
